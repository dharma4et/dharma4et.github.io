# Membership

There is _no membership requirement_ to attend any Appalachian Dharma & Meditation Center sessions.  

However becoming a member and supporting financially allows us to pay the rent and insurnce on the Center.

Anyone can become a member by making a monthly, semi-annual, or annual donation of any amount.  Your pledge amount is self-determined based upon your means and inspiration.  Whatever support you are able to offer is greatly appreciated.

There are two forms you can use to join:

* Online Form
* [Print/Mail Form](/static/MembershipForm2017.pdf)

# Donations

We graciously accept donations in many forms:

* Money (i.e., check, money order, cash in the dana box)
* Items needed at The Center (i.e., straight-backed chairs, paper products, cookies, tea, tea cups, or other items from our Wish List)
* Support us by using our Amazon Store or [Food City Cards](/getinvolved/foodcity/)
* In-kind (i.e., printing of flyers and announcements, use of other facilities for large gatherings).

Donations can be one-time only or made on a semi-regular basis.  Placing a donation into the dana box each time you visit would be an example of a semi-regular donation and would be very welcome. Appalachian Dharma & Meditation Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and all donations are tax-deductible as provided by law.
