# Food City Cards

You can also help donate to ADMC by purchasing a Food City Community Cash gift card through ADMC.  For every dollar you purchase, we receive 5% in donation from Food City.  This is a great way to help your Sangha without spending any extra money!

A few details about the cards:

* The cards come in $10, $25, $50 & $100 denominations. 
* The cards are active upon receipt.
* Treat your card as cash. It is non-refundable and non-returnable.
* These cards can be used at any Food City front check out (but not self check out).  They can also be used in the bakery/deli, pharmacy or Gas N Go attendant window.
* You can check the balance of the card at any register.
* After 12 months of non-usage, a $2 monthly service fee will be deducted.
* Gift cards cannot be replenished at the store so discard it when done.
* If you would like to purchase more cards, contact Marina or Patty Jo.  We can reorder cards whenever we reach a minimum balance of $500 as a group.  Please specify what denominations you want.
* Make checks for cards out to Appalachian Dharma & Meditation Center or ADMC.
